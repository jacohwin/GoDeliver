# GoDeliver is a logistic delivery mobile application to link clients and vehicle service providers
The system will cater for the registration of authorized transportation service providers on the system using mobile application. 
Once the vehicle owners have registered their vehicles on our platform, we configure them with GPS trackers.
Also clients can register on our platform through the mobile application. 
Then we will link the vehicle to the clients requesting the delivery services. 
Once they have registered the can make an order for pick-point and specifies their destination with the size of the package they have and the type of the transportation means they need either motorbike, trucks, vans or lorries. 
The trucks, vans and lorries can be open or closed to satisfy client needs. 
There will end to end tracking of goods for accountability and transparency.
